pfrog
=====
"pfrog" is an ambigram of "free online role playing game". It was one of my very earliest programming projects that was started at latest in 2004, with PHP version 4 at the time.

The engine was supposed to host a game called "tycoonism", about becoming a tycoon, buying and selling slaves, businesses ad accessories.

In 2023 I thought it might be amusing to port it to a recent version of PHP, and clean up the code, with the 20 years of coding experience I've developed in the meantime! Allbeit a huge chunk of the code is very legacy. The bulk of it was developed at a time when 56k modems were very common still, XHTMLRequest / AJAX didn't exist, and CSS was version 2 or so.

This project is GPLv2, see the COPYING file.
